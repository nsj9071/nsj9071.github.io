<h1>Technology Risks</h1>

<p>Below are the risks we have identified from our research on ChatGPT</p>

<ul>
   <li>Dependence on Data Quality</li>
	<ul>
		
             <li><p>ChatGPT relies heavily on the data it was trained on. If the data contains biases, inaccuracies or limitations in it, the reponses given by the AI will be wrong depending on the question.
	            ChatGPT, although an AI uses the code programmed by man so therefore it cannot give a perfect response as the AI can contain parts of its developers perspective or opinion, and these 
	            opinions would be provided as facts by the AI. Therefore not all the information the AI has access to should be treated as facts.</p><br></li>
	</ul>
     <li>Risk of technical dependence and misuse</li>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Overreliance on AI models like chatgpt can lead to a lack of critical thinking and decision making skills, it is also suspected to misuse such as generating fake information.
		       As chatgpt has become popular many students have used the AI for various things, and if used occasionally will lead to the mind to become lazy and the user
		       will find themselves asking chatgpt about even the simplest of things. If used incorrectly can rob you of your creativity and awareness.</p><br></li>
	</ul>
              
    <li>Limitations on Knowledge Scope</li>
        <ul>
		<li><p>ChatGPT is limited to the data it was trained on up to a certain date. Currently chatgpt has information up to 2017, therefore until updated it will not have information on recent developments or specialized topics.
		       which means that if certain curriculums or calculations were changed after 2017 the result acquired from chatgpt would be inaccurate.</p><br></li>
	</ul>

     <li>Plagiarism</li>
	<ul>
		<li><p>ChatGPT can be used to produce results or help with assignments, the information generated when used without crediting the work as another's is  considered by many institutions as plagiarism.
		       Even if it was merely your ideas brought to life by ChatGPT many Educational Institutions have decided that any information or work which used ChatGPT and was not credited would be considered 
		       plagiarism. This was in an effort to reduce students reliance on the AI to the bare minimum.</p><br></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
