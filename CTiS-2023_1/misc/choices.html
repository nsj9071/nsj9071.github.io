<h1>Technology Choices</h1>


</ul><h4><p>ChatGPT is very useful in terms of learning and other academic
purposes. However, if we rely on this platform too much to operate
on tasks that even our minds can perform, this is where the
disadvantages take over. It will harm the mental state of the mind
that is responsible for creative and critical thinking. So although we
find ChatGPT helpful it needs limitations to ensure we can still do
work without it.<p><br></h4>
